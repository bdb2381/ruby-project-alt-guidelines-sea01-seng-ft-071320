 🚨WELCOME TO OUR APPLICATION : GOOD COP ? BAD COP 🚨
===============================================

"Good Cop ? Bad Cop" was built with the intention of allowing citizens to have a impact on positive policing in their community.

Within our app users will be allowed to create reviews through a numerical rating system, and incoorperate a comprehensive description of their interaction with a police officer. In addition, citizens can view police officers' average ratings other citizens have submitted.

If you or anybody you know has had an issue with police brutality and SPD please report it :
